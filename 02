Characteristics of File-Based Storage Systems
Simplicity: Easy to implement and understand.
Flexibility: Can store a wide variety of data formats (text, images, videos, etc.).
Compatibility: Widely supported across different operating systems and applications.
Major Challenges of File-Based Storage Systems
Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:

Redundancy: Duplicate data may be stored in multiple files, leading to unnecessary storage use.
Inconsistency: Changes in one file may not be reflected in another, leading to discrepancies.
Data Integrity and Security:

Lack of Integrity Constraints: There are no built-in mechanisms to enforce data integrity, such as ensuring valid data types or relationships between data.
Security: Limited control over access and permissions, making it harder to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
Difficulty in Data Retrieval and Management:

Searching: Finding specific data requires opening and reading files, which can be slow and inefficient for large datasets.
No Query Language: Unlike databases, there is no standardized query language like SQL for easy data retrieval and manipulation.
Concurrency Issues:

Simultaneous Access: Managing concurrent access by multiple users or applications can lead to conflicts and data corruption.
Scalability:

Performance Degradation: As the number of files grows, the file system may become less efficient, leading to slower access times and increased maintenance complexity.
Example Scenario
Consider a small business that stores its customer records in text files. Each customer has a separate file containing their details. As the business grows:

Redundancy: The same customer’s data might be duplicated in various places (e.g., in different departments’ directories).
Inconsistency: Updating a customer’s address in one file might not be reflected in another file.
Retrieval: Finding all customers who made purchases in the last month involves opening and searching through many files, which is time-consuming.
Conclusion
While file-based storage systems are simple and flexible, they face significant challenges in terms of redundancy, integrity, security, concurrency, and scalability. These limitations often lead organizations to adopt more robust solutions like Database Management Systems (DBMS) for managing their data efficiently and securely.
