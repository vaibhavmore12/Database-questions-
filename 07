Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.




=====>



The Three Schema Architecture, also known as the ANSI/SPARC architecture, is a conceptual framework that divides a database system into three distinct layers: the external, conceptual, and internal schemas. Each schema serves a specific purpose and provides a level of abstraction, allowing for data independence and flexibility in database design and management.

1. External Schema
Purpose: Represents the view of the database from the perspective of individual users or applications. Each user or application may have its own customized view of the data, tailored to its specific needs.
Advantages:
Data Independence: Changes to the internal schema do not affect external schemas, allowing for modifications to the database structure without impacting user applications.
Customization: Allows different users or applications to have their own customized view of the data, improving usability and efficiency.
Security: Provides a mechanism for controlling access to data by exposing only relevant portions of the database to each user or application.
2. Conceptual Schema
Purpose: Represents the overall logical structure of the entire database, independent of any specific user views or applications. It defines the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
Advantages:
Data Independence: Acts as an intermediary between the external and internal schemas, allowing changes to the database structure without affecting user applications.
Simplification: Simplifies database design by abstracting away the complexities of physical storage and optimization, focusing on the logical organization of data.
Consistency: Ensures consistency and integrity of the data model across all user views and applications, maintaining data quality and reliability.
3. Internal Schema
Purpose: Represents the physical storage and organization of data within the database system. It defines how data is stored on disk, including data structures, access methods, and optimization techniques.
Advantages:
Performance Optimization: Allows for optimization of data storage and access methods to improve database performance, such as indexing, partitioning, and clustering.
Security: Implements security measures at the physical level, such as encryption and access controls, to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
Scalability: Provides mechanisms for managing data storage and distribution to accommodate growing data volumes and user demands.
Overall Advantages of Three Schema Architecture
Data Independence: Provides layers of abstraction between the logical and physical aspects of the database, allowing for changes in one layer without impacting others.
Flexibility: Allows for customization and optimization at each layer to meet the specific needs of users and applications.
Maintainability: Simplifies database design, management, and maintenance by separating concerns and providing clear boundaries between different aspects of the database system.
Security: Enables fine-grained control over access to data and resources, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
By providing a structured framework for database design and management, the Three Schema Architecture promotes data consistency, usability, and efficiency in database systems.
